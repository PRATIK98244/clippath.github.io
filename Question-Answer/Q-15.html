    <h1>Question-15</h1>
        <h2>What are the external style sheets?</h2>

         <b>Answer:-</b>
         <br><br>

             -An external style sheet is a separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head 
         section of the webpage. Multiple webpages can use the same link to access the stylesheet. The link to an external
         style sheet is placed within the head section of the page.
         <hr><br>

             -External style sheets are created in separate documents with a .css extension. An external style sheet is
         simply a listing of CSS rules. It cannot contain HTML tags. The tag, which goes in the head of an HTML page, is
         used to link to an external style sheet. There is no limit to the number of external style sheets a single HTML
         page can use.
