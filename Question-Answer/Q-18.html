    <h1>Question-18</h1> 

           <h2>What are the media types allowed by CSS?</h2>

         <b>Answer:-</b>
         <br><br>
            
            <b><u>CSS2 Introduced Media Types</u></b>
            <br><br>

            -The @media rule, introduced in CSS2, made it possible to define different style rules for different media 
               types.
               <br><hr>

            -Examples: You could have one set of style rules for computer screens, one for printers, one for handheld
               devices, one for television-type devices, and so on.
               <br><hr>

            -Unfortunately these media types never got a lot of support by devices, other than the print media type.
            <br><hr>

   
            <b><u>CSS3 Introduced Media Queries:-</u></b>
            <br><br>

            -Media queries in CSS3 extended the CSS2 media types idea: Instead of looking for a type of device, they
               look at the capability of the device.
               <br>

            -Media queries can be used to check many things, such as:-

                  <li>width and height of the viewport</li>
                  <li>width and height of the device</li>
                  <li>orientation (is the tablet/phone in landscape or portrait mode?)</li>
                  <li> resolution</li>
                  <br><hr>
                  
 
            -Using media queries are a popular technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to desktops, laptops,
               tablets, and mobile phones (such as iPhone and Android phones).
