    <h1> Question-10</h1>
    
            <h2>Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h2>

         <b>Answer:-</b>
            <br><br>
            -There are two reasons behind this: It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in 
         CSS, and if it is combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
         <hr><br>

            -background is a shorthand property that allows you to set all the background properties (including the background-color ) in one
         line. On the other hand, background-color property sets the color of the background of an element.
         <hr><br>

            -The background-color property sets the background color of an element. The background of an element is the total size of the 
         element, including padding and border (but not the margin). Tip: Use a background color and a text color that makes the text easy to
         read.
         <hr><br>
            
            -So the background property can be used as a convenient short-hand that can apply multiple declarations in one line, and save you
         many lines of code. Declaration = CSS property + value. The background-color property, on the other hand, can only set the background 
         color of an element.
         <hr><br>

         -Color is an inherited property while the background is not.
