    <h1>Question-17</h1>
        <h2>What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h2>

         <b>Answer:-</b>
         <br><br>
         
           -A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the
            browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.
            <br><hr>

           -CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
           <br><br>

           <b><u>We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:-</u></b>
           <br><br>

           *Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
           <br><hr>

           *Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
           <br><hr>

           *Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
           <br><hr>

           *Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
           <br><hr>
           
           *Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
