    <h1>Question-16</h1>
  <h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h2>

        <b>Answer:-</b> 
        <br><br>

             <b><u>External style sheets have the following advantages over internal and inline styles:</u></b>
             <br><br>

             -one change to the style sheet will change all linked pages.
             <br><hr>

             -you can create classes of styles that can then be used on many different HTML elements.
             <br><hr>

             -consistent look and feel across multiple web pages.
             <br><hr>

             -Using them, the styles of multiple documents can be controlled from one file.
             <br><hr>

             -Classes can be created for use on multiple HTML element types in many documents.
             <br><hr>

             -In complex situations, selector and grouping methods can be used to apply styles.
             <br><br>


             <b><u>The disadvantages of External Style Sheets are:-</u></b>
             <br><br>

             -In order to import style information for each document, an extra download is needed.
             <br><hr>

             -Until the external style sheet is loaded, it may not be possible to render the document.
             <br><hr>

             -For small number of style definitions, it is not viable.
             <br><hr>

             -CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers.
             <br><hr>

             -With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test
              for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.
             <br><hr>

             -There exists a scarcity of security.
             <br><hr>

             -After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects 
              on all the browsers.
